# Summary
This project focused on how to increase Uber's order growth in 2015 by creating campaign suggestion using cluster analysis.
The dataset contains Uber Inc's order data in New York City from January 2009 - June 2015.
We found that orders were having down trend from 2012, and from that trend we aimed to increase the orders by creating customer segmentation using cluster analysis (Silhouette & Elbow Method) and to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better interpretation & visualization. On top of that, we created the suggested campaign to each customer segmentation, also created the prediction of the order increase using Timeseries-Analysis Prophet if Uber manages to execute the campaigns successfully. FInally, we created a dashboard for reporting of each metrics and important variables using Tableau
